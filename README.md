## Obsolete project
As of 4th May 2017, this repository is no longer maintained or supported.
After a code review, it is deemed that there is nothing of real use here except the modular model binder.
This real desire for that model binder is to handle the binding of *open generic types* (because Autofac uses attributes to indicate a model binding type). 
This functionality will be better handled by subclassing Autofac's binder implementation and adding support for open generics.
